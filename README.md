Hello everyone!

I'm Brandon. I like Javascript and Python. My hobbies include coding as well as researching
computer hardware development. I have built many pc's (for myself and my friends) and am currently 
running a Ryzen 5 1600 PC at 3.7GHz @ 1.30V with 3200MHz of DDR4 RAM at 16-18-18-36 latencies at 1T.

I consider myself a PC enthusiast on a budget ^^
